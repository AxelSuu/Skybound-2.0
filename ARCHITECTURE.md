# GAME ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
# ==============================================================================

"""
Skybound follows a modular, object-oriented architecture with clear separation
of concerns. The game is structured around several key systems:

1. STATE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
   - File-based persistence using text files
   - Central state machine for screen transitions
   - Consistent data access patterns

2. GAME LOOP ARCHITECTURE
   - Main game loop with fixed timestep
   - Separate update and render phases
   - Event-driven input handling

3. SPRITE SYSTEM
   - Pygame sprite groups for efficient collision detection
   - Hierarchical sprite classes with shared functionality
   - Component-based approach for game objects

4. LEVEL GENERATION SYSTEM
   - Hybrid approach: static Level 1, procedural Level 2+
   - Algorithm-based platform placement
   - Dynamic difficulty scaling

5. EFFECTS AND AUDIO SYSTEM
   - Particle-based visual effects
   - Procedural sound generation
   - Spatial audio with distance-based attenuation

# DESIGN PATTERNS USED
# ==============================================================================

"""
1. STATE MACHINE PATTERN
   Used in: Main game loop (main.py)
   Purpose: Manages transitions between game states (menu, game, pause, etc.)
   
2. OBSERVER PATTERN
   Used in: Achievement system, effects manager
   Purpose: Decoupled event handling and notifications
   
3. FACTORY PATTERN
   Used in: Enemy creation (mob_types.py), power-up spawning
   Purpose: Creates objects based on level and game state
   
4. SINGLETON PATTERN
   Used in: Sound manager, settings manager
   Purpose: Global access to shared resources
   
5. COMPONENT PATTERN
   Used in: Player class with power-up components
   Purpose: Modular functionality that can be mixed and matched

# PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
# ==============================================================================

"""
1. COLLISION DETECTION OPTIMIZATION
   - Uses pygame sprite groups for efficient collision queries
   - Hierarchical collision detection (broad phase → narrow phase)
   - Optimized hitboxes separate from visual sprites

2. RENDERING OPTIMIZATION
   - Minimal draw calls through sprite group rendering
   - Efficient background scrolling with texture reuse
   - Particle system with object pooling

3. MEMORY MANAGEMENT
   - Proper cleanup of temporary objects
   - Efficient texture atlasing through spritesheets
   - Lazy loading of assets when needed

4. AUDIO OPTIMIZATION
   - Procedural sound generation to reduce file size
   - Efficient mixing through pygame channels
   - Distance-based volume calculation
